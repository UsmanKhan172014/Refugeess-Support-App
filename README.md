# Refugeess-Support-App
This is a java Swing and Java Web Socket Programming app with
all basic features and if you want to run the program you have to import it to your desired IDE Like Netbeans and Eclipse(I made this on Eclipse
because I personally love eclipse) so anyways open the project and then there is a package name application and in the application section there
is a console app just simply run it.
it might be run.java and there are wallpapers which are misplaced just add the class path of images to them and they shall start working
as expected.
You can also chat with it.
